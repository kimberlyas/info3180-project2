## Background
While it is possible to create a wish list on Amazon, or similar sites there are
some things that Amazon does not sell. For example if a vacation to a resort in
Jamaica was on your wishlist you couldn't add that using Amazon's wishlist
system. Or maybe you want a dinner from a local restaurant or an appliance
from a local dealer.

For this we will create a wish list system that we can share with our friends
based on everything we are interested in.

## Key Functionality
You should be able to sign up for an account on our wishlist web application.
Once a user has an account, they should be able to login and add items to their
wishlist based on a website URL. Each wishlist item, should have a title,
description, website address and a thumbnail image. Thumbnail images are
obtained by scrapping the link to the website for all images and allowing the user
to select one before they save the item to their wishlist.

Details about the API can be found at: http://docs.wishlist14.apiary.io/ .
